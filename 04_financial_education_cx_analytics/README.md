# 📚 Financial Education & CX Analytics – Power BI Dashboard

## 🎯 Objective
Evaluate learning outcomes, participant performance, and customer experience
(CX) indicators in a large-scale financial education program.

The dashboard supports academic coordination and strategic decisions by
monitoring results, engagement, and certification effectiveness.

## 📊 Context
This project analyzes results from a financial education program delivered
during the 2025-1 academic period, combining learning assessments and
experience indicators.

All data is presented as an anonymized case study for portfolio purposes.

## 📌 Key Indicators
- Average learning score (Entry vs Exit)
- Results by cycle, campus, and program
- CES, CSAT (quality & information), and NPS scores
- Certification rates and completion
- CX distribution by module and demographic variables

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Exit scores consistently outperform entry scores across all cycles
- Financial cybersecurity and fraud detection show the highest learning gains
- Engagement varies significantly by campus and study level
- High satisfaction (CSAT > 90%) does not always translate into certification
- The main CX risk lies in partial completion rather than dissatisfaction
