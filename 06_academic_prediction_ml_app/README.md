# 🎓 Academic Performance Prediction – Machine Learning App

## 🎯 Objective
Develop and deploy a machine learning application to predict student outcomes
(approval, failure, and absenteeism) based on academic, demographic, and
contextual variables.

The application supports early intervention strategies and data-driven
decision-making in higher education.

## 📊 Context
This project was developed as part of a Data Science & Machine Learning program
and is based on historical academic data from a technical higher-education
institution.

All data is presented as an anonymized case study for portfolio purposes.

## 🧠 Model Overview
The application integrates and compares multiple machine learning models:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (Binary Logistic)
- XGBoost (Multiclass Softmax)
- CatBoost

Each model outputs probability scores for:
- Approval
- Failure
- Absenteeism

## 📌 Features Used
- Campus (Sede)
- Academic program
- Academic cycle
- Class shift (Turno)
- First evaluation grade (Evaluation 1)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- Gradio
- Hugging Face Spaces

## 🚀 Deployment
The model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Gradio** and
hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, allowing real-time scenario simulation.
